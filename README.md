# Java snake game

Snake is an older classic video game. In this game the player controls a snake. The objective is to eat as many apples as possible. Each time the snake eats an apple its body grows. The snake must avoid the walls and its own body. 

This is a Java 2D Snake game clone. The initial size of each part of the snake body is set according to a chosen _UNIT_SIZE_. The snake is controlled with the cursor keys. Initially, the snake has 6 body parts. If the game is finished, the _Game Over_ message is displayed in the middle of the board.
Each time the snake eats an apple, its body grows and the score increases.
